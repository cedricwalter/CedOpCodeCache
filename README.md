# CedOpCodeCache
As you know, OPcache has no management page. This administrator module offers you an OPcache dashboard designed for Joomla.

OPcache improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script bytecode in shared memory, thereby removing the need for PHP to load and parse scripts on each request.
